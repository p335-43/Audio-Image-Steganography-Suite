# Audio-Image Steganography Suite

**Audio-Image Steganography Suite** is a Flask-based web application that enables secure communication by embedding images into audio files and encoding messages within images. It supports encryption, decryption, and retrieval of hidden data with ease.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Image Steganography**: Encode text messages into images and decode them effortlessly.
- **Audio Steganography**: Embed images within audio files without altering image pixels.
- **Secure Communication**: Protect sensitive information by hiding it in media files.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A chat-like interface for managing media files and hidden data.
- **File Download Support**: Download encrypted media files for sharing.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask Framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with Flask Templates)
- **Libraries**:
  - [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) for image processing.
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for handling binary data.
  - [Wave](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html) for audio file manipulation.
- **Database**: None (in-memory storage for chat messages).

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Image Steganography
- **Encode a Message**: Upload an image, enter a message, and encrypt it.
- **Decode a Message**: Upload the encrypted image to retrieve the hidden message.

### 2. Audio Steganography
- **Embed an Image**: Upload an image and an audio file to embed the image into the audio.
- **Extract an Image**: Upload the stego-audio file to extract the embedded image.

## 📂 Examples

- **Encrypted Image Example**:  
  ![Example Encrypted Image](path/to/example-encrypted-image.png)
- **Decoded Message Example**:  
  "Hello, this is a secret!"

## 🔒 Security Features

- Steganography ensures the hidden data remains undetectable to casual viewers.
- Uses a delimiter and header system for precise extraction of data.
